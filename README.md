BookHub— a simplified way to search Books!

[Problem Statement]

Develop a pseudo frontend application which would let users search and list books conveniently.

[Minimum Requirement]

— Use of Web API (available in JSON) to fetch books detail:

Data Parameters: id, name, image, author, price, rating, details[], description
— Visually interactive responsive design listing book details. (emphasis on UI/design part)

— Save Source code and instruction.

[Plus Point]

— Implement Search (by name, author, rating), Sort (by price, rating) feature.

— Twist: There's an unicode rupee sign in 'price' field, handle it gracefully!

— Documented, well structured beautified code.

— Feel free to use your favourite UI/UX frameworks and tools in development and design.

[Extra Work] (if time permits)

— A feature to bookmark. (HTML5 Localstorage)

— Display and keep track of number of total Bookmarks / number of total Books.

— Awesome if you could manage to host this application somewhere with Demo URL! (heroku or openshift)

— Custom elegant design, fonts and icons to make an app more user-friendly.

— You may add portfolio activity comprising awesome work you have done on web application.

— Use your imagination and add features which would make things easier for end users.

[Guide]

— Book details API: https://capillary.0x10.info/api/books?type=json&query=list_books

— Ideal Frontend Stack: Bootstrap, Typography, Subtle pattern, Custom Icons.

— PS: Application can be built with use of client-side scripting and need not require any backend.

— HTML5 Local Storage: http://html5demos.com/storage
